This is a JavaScript program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console

This line uses the console.log function to print a message to the console
console.log("Hello, World!");
Let me explain what each line of the code does:
This is a JavaScript program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console:
This is a comment, which is a line of code that is ignored by the JavaScript interpreter.
Comments are used to add notes or explanations to the code, making it easier for humans to understand.
In this case, the comment is simply stating the purpose of the program.
console.log("Hello, World!");
This line uses the console.log function to print a message to the console.
The console.log function is a built-in function in JavaScript that outputs a message to the console.
The message is passed as a string argument, which in this case is "Hello, World!".
When the code is executed, the console.log function will print the string "Hello, World!" 
to the console, followed by a newline character.
